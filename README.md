# project-robot-apocalypse

* The year is 2050 and the world has been taken over by robots. I as a programmer, have tried to reponsibly save this world from zoombies and have come up with an application for same!

* This is a spring boot java application "robot-apocalypse", exposing REST APIs to add survivor, update his/her last location, report a survivors infected status, and retrieve live reports comprising of infected and non-infected survivors percentage, list of infected and non  infected survivors, as well as list of robots. 

* This application uses an in memory database H2 which can be swapped with any alternate database with some minimal external properties configuration.

* robot-apocalypse-swagger-doc.yaml is a documentation file of this project which contains all information regarding the REST endpoints exposed and the way they can be accessed. This document can be better viewed in a UI over browser using: https://editor.swagger.io/.
